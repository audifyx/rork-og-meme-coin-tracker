/**
 * Single catch-all serverless function for the entire OG DEX API.
 *
 * Vercel's Hobby plan caps a deployment at 12 serverless functions, and each
 * file in /api normally becomes its own function. To stay under the limit (and
 * keep adding endpoints freely), every route lives in api/_routes/*.js — the
 * leading underscore folder is excluded from Vercel's function count — and this
 * one function dispatches to them by the first path segment.
 *
 * Frontend URLs are unchanged: /api/wallet, /api/launch?config=1, etc.
 * To add a new endpoint: drop api/_routes/<name>.js and register it below.
