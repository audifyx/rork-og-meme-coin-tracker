# Build OG Scan V3: forensic-grade OG token intelligence engine

## **Features**

- [x] Add a live **Snipe Feed** that tracks brand-new Solana launches as they appear.
- [x] Add **Dev Wallet History** so users can see if a launch came from a known repeat creator.
- [x] Add **Popular Dev Tracking** for wallets that have launched coins with strong past performance.
- [x] Add a **Launch Quality Score** that quickly labels new coins as hot, risky, suspicious, or clean.
- [x] Add **rug warning signals** for mint authority, freeze authority, weak liquidity, top-holder risk, and clone behavior.
- [x] Add **copycat detection** that warns when a token looks like a fake version of an older ticker.
- [x] Add **watch alerts** so users can follow a dev wallet, ticker, or mint and see fresh activity faster.
- [x] Add **quick action buttons** to open chart, copy contract address, inspect dev history, and send the token into scanner or swap.
- [x] Add **community heat signals** showing which launches are gaining traction fastest.
- [x] Keep every existing tool intact while making the new intelligence feel like a premium V2 layer.
- [x] Replace the old token-coming-soon banner with the live official OGScan coin CA, dev wallet, chart links, and copy actions.
- [x] Add the official **SolTools Roadmap** with goal, plan, next step, long-term vision, expansion plans, mobile rollout, mission, and community links.
- [x] Add a new **Community Beta homepage** as the first screen with iOS/Android Expo Go instructions, beta link, issue tips, and an enter-OGScan button.
- [x] Update the landing page beta area into a **Community HQ** notice with Telegram, backup X, and DEX-update messaging.
- [x] Add direct standalone routes for every OGScan tool so each page can be embedded link-for-link in the mobile app.
- [x] Create a standalone embed prompt file explaining every page, route, numbered path, and mobile-app embedding approach.
- [x] Add a forensic **Narrative Fingerprint ID** system that normalizes casing, punctuation, unicode, emoji noise, duplicate characters, and leetspeak variants.
- [x] Add universal token clustering for narrative searches so symbols like `$PEPE`, `P.E.P.E`, `ＰＥＰＥ`, and `P3P3` resolve into one attribution graph.
- [x] Add a 12-factor **TRUE_OG_SCORE** formula that prioritizes earliest chain origin, earliest liquidity, first transaction evidence, deployer trust, metadata stability, organic behavior, clone confidence, and narrative continuity.
- [x] Add deployer / wallet trust, clone confidence, liquidity authenticity, migration probability, CTO probability, manipulated relaunch probability, and artificial trend probability outputs.
- [x] Add chronological origin timelines and token family tree relationships for TRUE OG, early clone, migration, CTO, revival, fake revival, community fork, and exploit copy labels.
- [x] Keep price, market cap, holders, volume, trend status, and migration status out of OG selection logic.
- [x] Add a reusable **Coin Intelligence Popup** across tools with image/banner, metadata, live chart, buys/sells, liquidity, DEX paid/boosts, audit data, links, and copy/scan actions.
- [x] Add a global layered token classification model that returns `primary_label`, `secondary_labels`, `confidence_scores`, and `reasoning_summary` for every narrative cluster.
- [x] Split classification into **Origin Identity**, **Control Status**, and **Lifecycle Status** so TRUE OG CTO, migrations, revivals, clones, and copycats can all show layered truth without forcing one flat label.
- [x] Add live DexScreener paid-order intelligence for token profile, CTO, ads, first/last paid timing, and active boost counts.
- [x] Add CTO/dev-launch wallet history intelligence showing inferred creator wallet, bonded coin count, DEX-paid coin count, boosted coins, and CTO order count.
- [x] Make DexScreener the chart source across token popups, Vitals, chart actions, and chart/provider labels.
- [x] Add ATH date plus ATH/ATL values across scanner results, Vitals, Snipe Feed, migrations, trending, pair cards, and coin popups.
- [x] Add a live **Feed** tool that shows current trending tokens, why each token is trending, spotlight coins, high-ranking runners, bundle-risk status, DEX paid/boost analytics, and CTO/dev-launch intelligence.
- [x] Upgrade Feed bundle tracking with largest-holder owner resolution, estimated bundle count, suspected bundler wallets, holder concentration, and tracking notes.
- [x] Upgrade dev wallet analytics with farming risk, rug/dead-coin risk, low-liquidity linked coin counts, average linked liquidity, and dev risk labels.
- [x] Add a viral catalyst/news feed that watches RSS/news/X-style Elon/Trump/news narratives and matches live meme coins to those topics.
- [x] Make OGSCAN attribution Solana-only and protect canonical origin mappings such as Fartcoin `9BB6NFEcjBCtnNLFko2FqVQBq8HHM13kCyYcdQbgpump` from scam/copycat overrides.
- [x] Separate **first credible Solana OG** from **later official/verified tokens**, so TRUMP/YE-style later official launches show as `LATER OFFICIAL` without replacing the original mint.
- [x] Add **quote-backed LP / LP-pulled exclusion** so dead-liquidity or pulled-pool scams cannot become TRUE OG even if they are first on-chain or show inflated market cap.
- [x] Add **full frontend-only enrichment** using existing Helius, Birdeye, Pump.fun, and DexScreener APIs: mint/freeze authorities, token accounts, largest holders, creator/funding txs, ATH/ATL, holders, price, liquidity, MC/FDV, Pump.fun creator/bonding/migration duration, all DEX pools, pair dates, boosts, orders, and paid-promotion signals.
- [x] Hard-block known LP-pulled/scam mint `5sNU6g1qVji5dEBnb6SWSX2Gu2rtDvvk7khKyujj6cuU` and apply the same dead-liquidity logic to future candidates.
- [x] Add the V3.1 **Dominance Engine** so every same-ticker cluster separates immutable First Mint / Legacy OG proof from the current Primary token by market cap, liquidity depth, holder quality, social adoption, on-chain activity, creator strength, and earliest-mint bonus.
- [x] Add new classification tiers: `REVIVED OFFICIAL`, `LEGACY OG`, and `CONTESTED`, while keeping LP-pulled/scam tokens excluded before any Primary/Legacy scoring.
- [x] Upgrade **Scan Any Mint** with advanced forensic filters for dominance, origin, risk, liquidity, market cap, holders, clone status, LP safety, authority safety, ATH availability, DEX-paid signals, and sort modes.
- [x] Add expanded scanner score cards showing Dominance, Origin, Risk, Clone, Authority, Holders, Top 10 concentration, Activity, Pools, First Mint, ATH, migration, and DEX paid/boost status.
- [x] Redesign scanner token results into collectible forensic cards with holo rarity treatments, token art panels, Primary/Legacy/Clone/Danger badges, stat tiles, and quick action tools.
- [x] Fix collector cards so the actual token image is the main card artwork, with key LP/holder/DEX data overlaid directly on the image.
- [x] Remove ATH/ATL from OG scanner card surfaces and keep market-extreme data inside deeper intel views.
- [x] Fix holder and whale display fallbacks so unknown or unreliable provider values like `1` no longer show as real holder/whale counts.
- [x] Separate `og` back to first credible mint while keeping `primaryToken` as the current dominance leader, preventing later tokens from being shown as the OG.

## **Design**

- [x] Use a sharper blue, black, and white Solana-style command center theme.
- [x] Make each tool feel like a separate premium panel with clear headers, borders, labels, and status chips.
- [x] Redesign the workspace so each tool opens as its own full-page tab instead of one chaotic scrolling page.
- [x] Convert tool navigation from internal-only tabs into real URL pages such as `/scanner`, `/snipe-feed`, `/migrations`, and `/page/6`.
- [x] Give the Snipe Feed a fast live-market feel with pulsing rows, “new launch” badges, and clear risk colors.
- [x] Use simple beginner-friendly labels like “Clean,” “Watch,” “Risky,” and “Danger” instead of overwhelming users.
- [x] Add a stronger top summary area showing live launches, risky launches blocked, watched devs, and hot opportunities.
- [x] Make the layout easier to scan on mobile with stacked cards and sticky quick actions.
- [x] Present the roadmap as a premium full-page tab instead of a plain text block.
- [x] Make the beta announcement feel like a polished launch page while keeping the existing OG scanner UI behind the enter button.
- [x] Refresh the root landing page copy so the main calls-to-action point users to Telegram and backup X until the DEX update is ready.
- [x] Upgrade Scanner results with forensic probability chips, Narrative ID, clone count, chain count, TRUE OG label, and attribution labels.
- [x] Upgrade OG Finder into a forensic origin report with timeline proof, lineage map, confidence metrics, migration/CTO/trend warnings, and direct evidence explanations.
- [x] Update the Tech page to describe the new attribution pipeline instead of a generic token scanner pipeline.
- [x] Redesign the full tool workspace with a modern glass shell, stronger page boundaries, clearer tool start/end markers, premium route headers, and improved side navigation without changing routes.
- [x] Replace the rough nested search/input boxes with a unified premium glass search system across Scanner, OG Finder, Vitals, Pairs, Swap, Migrations, and Trending filters.
- [x] Rebuild the app workspace around a persistent left sidebar, mobile tool dock, focused top context bar, and single clean tool canvas while preserving every existing route.
- [x] Add premium responsive coin detail modals so every tool can inspect a token without leaving the current route or losing context.
- [x] Surface layered labels and secondary badges across Scanner results, OG Finder cards, lineage reports, and the shared coin intelligence popup.

- [x] Replace internal/Birdeye-rendered chart panels with DexScreener chart embeds and full-chart links.
- [x] Add a dedicated `/feed` workspace page with spotlight cards, runner board, full live feed rows, and a sticky coin analytics panel.
- [x] Add Feed panels for viral news catalysts, matched meme coins, suspected bundlers, and dev farming/rug history.
- [x] Update OG Finder and the shared Coin Intelligence Popup to show Primary Status, Dominance %, rank, First Mint / Legacy OG, mint authority wallet, and clear notes when a later token is dominant but not first on-chain.
- [x] Refresh the root landing page around OGScan’s actual tool stack: mint forensics, first-origin proof, dominance scoring, LP/holder risk, migrations, dev wallets, boosts, and live market catalysts.
- [x] Keep the landing-page messaging focused on scanner, launch, market, swap, and token-intel capabilities instead of describing the UI layout changes.
- [x] Add scanner preset filter packs, richer result-card density, visible risk counters, and primary/first-mint summary stats for faster token triage.
- [x] Give OG Finder and Scan Any Mint Pokémon-style collector-card visuals with animated holo sweeps, rarity chips, safer mobile spacing, and clearer token status hierarchy.
- [x] Improve collector-card readability with token-image art panels, overlay stats, DexScreener chart actions, and clearer First Mint vs Primary hierarchy.

## **Suggested build order**

- [x] First build the **Snipe Feed** and launch scoring so the app instantly feels more powerful.
- [x] Then add **Dev Wallet Intel** because it is the most differentiated feature and matches your idea best.
- [x] Then add **Watchlist and Alerts** so users have a reason to keep coming back.
- [x] Then polish the entire dashboard into a premium V2 experience.
